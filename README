Configurate
===========
I tend to try and stick to application defaults as far as possible, but not obsessively, and if an application can be configured to suit me better it would be rather foolish to ignore the possibilities.

Configurate, therefore, is a collection of config files and other scripts that configure the tools I use so that they suit me.

Installing the scripts
----------------------
install.sh is a very simple script to copy the files to the correct locations.  

If you are using TwitVim, you will still need to go into ~/.vimrc and enter your User ID and password.

Notes
-----
filetype.vim and mysyntax.vim are included to support syntax highlighting for the IBM i and are based on files written by Martin Rowe
The actual syntax files can be found at: http://www.dbg400.net/foswiki/bin/view/DBG400/EditingWithVim#Syntax_checking
They will need to be downloaded to your ~/.vim folder
