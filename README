Configurate
===========
I tend to try and stick to application defaults as far as possible, but not obsessively, and if an application can be configured to suit me better it would be rather foolish to ignore the possibilities.

Configurate, therefore, is a collection of config files and other scripts that configure the tools I use so that they suit me.

File locations
--------------
vimrc       should be copied to     ~/.vimrc
bashrc      should be copied to     ~/.bashrc
            and                     /root/.bashrc
